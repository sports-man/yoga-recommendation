The nozzle\r\non the end of the spout should fit comfortably into the\r\nnostril so that the water does not leak out. Even a teapot\r\nmay be used if the tip of the spout is not too large or sharp.\r\nThe water should be pure, at body temperature and\r\nthoroughly mixed with salt in the proportion of one\r\nteaspoonful per half litre of water. The addition of salt\r\nensures the osmotic pressure of the water is equal to that of\r\nthe body fluids, thereby minimizing any irritation to the\r\nmucous membrane. A painful or burning sensation is an\r\nindication of too little or too much salt in the water.\r\nStage I: Washing the nostrils\r\nFill the neti pot with the prepared salt water.\r\nStand squarely, with legs apart so that the body weight is\r\nevenly distributed between the feet. Lean fonvard and tilt\r\nthe head to one side.\r\nBreathe through the mouth.\r\nGently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril.\r\nThere should be no force involved.\r\nThe nozzle should press firmly against the side of the\r\nnostril so that no water leakage occurs.\r\nTilt the neti pot in such a way that water runs into the\r\nnostril and not down the face.\r\nKeep the mouth open. Raising the elbow of the hand\r\nwhich holds the neti pot helps to adjust the body position\r\nso that the water flows out through the lower nostril.\r\nWhen half the water has passed through the nostrils,\r\nremove the nozzle from the nostril, centre the head and\r\nlet the water run out of the nose.\r\nRemove any mucus from the nose by b1owing gently.\r\nTilt the head to the opposite side and repeat the process,\r\nplacing the nozzle of the Iota in the upper nostril.\r\nAfter completing this process, the nostrils must be\r\nthoroughly dried.\r\nStage 2: Drying the nostrils\r\n1. Stand erect.\r\nClose the right nostril with the right thumb and breathe\r\nin and out through the left nostril 10 times in quick\r\nsuccession, as in kapalbhati pranayama.\r\nRepeat through the right nostril, with the left nostril closed.\r\nPerform once more through both nostrils.\r\n2.
